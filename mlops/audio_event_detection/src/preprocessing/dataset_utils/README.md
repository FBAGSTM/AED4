# AED Dataset Utils

We have extended the original Model Zoo by adding a dedicated section that provides comprehensive information for both the ESC-50 and FSD50K datasets used in audio event detection (AED).

This includes:
- Dataset licenses
- README files
- Class names

These resources are intended to help users better understand the datasets, their usage terms, and the available audio event classes.
You can refer to these files to ensure proper usage and compliance with dataset licenses.
